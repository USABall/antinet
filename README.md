# antinet
the antinet, a more safe version of the internet, the only purpose of this repo is to have people download the antinet, if you want to add a website start a pull request, i mean
you could see the source code if you want, but this repo exists for 2 functionalities, the ability to add a website, and download the project, you can see requirements:
Hard Disk Requirements: 1KB
Hard Disk Recommdations: atleast 10KB
Why is this recommended?
this is recommended because we are always updating the antinet and barely updating the readme file
Program Requirements:Python
Operating System Requirements:Windows
most people should be able to meet these, accept python, or you are using an 8 bit OS, but then you can't meet the windows requirement, i honestly don't know if this will run on MS-DOS so don't ask me, which is itself a 16 bit OS, so it could still handle it, it could work if they're is a version of python for DOS, but i'm not sure, anyway who uses DOS anyway?
